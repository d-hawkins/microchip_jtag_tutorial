This tutorial (and associated design files) demonstrates the use of the
Microchip UJTAG component: simulation, synthesis, and hardware
implementation.
%
The UJTAG component and the JTAG-to-Register example form the basis
for more complex JTAG interface components:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{JTAG-to-AXI-Stream Bridge}

The JTAG-to-AXI-Stream bridge interfaces JTAG serial data streams into
byte streams compiliant with the ARM
\href{https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0051/latest}
{AMBA AXI-Stream Protocol Specification}.
%
The JTAG TDO bit-stream is converted to an AXI-Stream Transmitter
byte-stream, while the JTAG TDI bit-stream is used to receive data
from an AXI-Stream Receiver byte-stream.

\item \textbf{JTAG-to-AXI Bridge}

The JTAG-to-AXI bridge interfaces JTAG serial data streams into transactions
compliant with the ARM
\href{https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0022/latest}
{AMBA AXI Protocol Specification}.
%
The JTAG-to-AXI bridge combines the JTAG-to-AXI-Stream Bridge with an
AXI-Stream-to-AXI Manager.

\end{itemize}

These components can be found on the same github as this tutorial.
